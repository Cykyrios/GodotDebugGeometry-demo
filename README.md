This is a demo project for the DebugGeometry utility script.

A set of shapes is drawn for 10 seconds, random shapes can be added by clicking the left mouse button.

The view can be rotated using the right mouse button.

## Example
The following screenshot is from a small quadcopter simulation, where DebugGeometry is used to draw world and local velocity vectors, as well as visualize propeller lift.
